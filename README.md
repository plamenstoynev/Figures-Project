# Figures Project

Welcome to the **Figures Project**! This project provides an efficient way to create, convert, and manage various geometric figures, designed with robust design patterns to support flexibility and extensibility.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Factory Pattern for Figures**: Dynamically creates instances of various geometric figures.
- **String Conversion Utilities**: Easily convert strings to figure objects and vice versa.
- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Includes tests to ensure accurate and reliable figure operations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Figures Project on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- **CMake**: For build automation.

## 🛠️ Usage

- Create Figures: Interactively input parameters to generate different geometric figures.
- Convert Figures: Use the string conversion utilities to transform between strings and figure objects.
- Run Tests: Execute the provided test suite to verify functionality.

🧩 Project Structure

 -	Factories/: Contains factory classes to create figure instances efficiently.
- src/: Main source code for core application functionalities.
- 	stringConverter/: Utilities for handling string conversions.
-	tests/: Unit tests to validate application features.

📝 Examples

Example usage and commands:
	1.	Create a Figure
